FAQs
====

**Is “www.aka.msn/phonelinkqrc” the right link?**  

It’s a common typo. Use `aka.ms/phonelinkqrc <#>`_ for the official Microsoft page.

**Does this work with iPhone?**  

Yes—basic features like calls, messages, and notifications are supported. Some advanced app streaming features remain Android-only.

**Do I need to keep my phone nearby?**  

For the best performance (especially for calls and notifications), keep your phone powered on and near your PC, connected to the internet.

Pairing uses a Microsoft account plus a one-time QR handshake on your devices. You can unlink anytime from **Phone Link → Settings** or your Microsoft account device list.
